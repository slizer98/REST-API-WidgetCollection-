# Project Contribution Guidelines
## Overview
This document contains the guidelines for contributing to the project as well as our code of conduct when interacting with other people, as we seek to maintain a hobby project but with the best software practices that at the same time are easy to follow by everyone, regardless of experience in web programming.

## Code of Conduct
Persons wishing to collaborate in the project in any aspect must adhere to the contents of this code of conduct as well as to the principles it mentions, whether explicitly written or not.
- All persons collaborating in the project or other third parties involved shall be treated with respect and dignity (not necessarily in a formal manner).
- Unjustified discrimination, insults or quarrels are not tolerated in interactions within the project or its members.
- We should try to guide or support as much as possible people with less experience or with doubts regarding the project, if we are aware that we can support and provide someone with help it is our moral obligation to help them so that we can collaborate better and better in the project.
- The conversation space, source code or repository is not a space for any kind of advertising, spam, proselytism or political message of any kind, so you should not introduce or focus conversations to these topics directly.
- Everyone's work should be acknowledged, so plagiarism or credit for work should always be attributed to the original author if necessary, it is understood that all work shared here, whether in the form of source code, web pages, images or other written expression or any other kind of intellectual property (software source code, configurations, etc.) should be shared under the GPLv3.0 license, higher or compatible, and for artistic works the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License if it is an artistic or literary work.

## Contribution Guidelines
These are some of the most basic guidelines and/or rules to follow when anyone wishes to contribute to the project:
- Choose a programming style that is predictable and simple to read.
- Preferably, comments should explain WHAT a certain part of the code does rather than HOW (this applies especially to Javascript scripts) because if the source code is predictable, readable and well done, it will not be necessary to explain how it does it but rather what it is used for.
- Before uploading a new widget to the repository it should be tested using the libraries indicated in the project.
- You should ALWAYS follow the best practices of inclusion for people with disabilities so that these tools can be useful to as many people as possible.
