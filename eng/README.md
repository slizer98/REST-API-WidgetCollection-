(La versión en Español es encuentra [aquí](../README.md))

This project (as the name indicates) is a collection of mini-applications made in HTML/CSS/Javascript that make use of free REST APIs for entertainment, web application programming practice and teamwork purposes.

## Objectives
- Collect and share information sources that can be consumed through a REST API.
- Share API information in an interesting, simple and/or fun way.
- Program and make available a mini-application for each REST API that can be used within an iframe element within other sites.
